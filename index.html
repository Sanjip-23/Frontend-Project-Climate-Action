            Climate action refers to efforts taken to combat climate change and
            its impacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reducing short-lived climate pollutants will prevent millions of
            premature deaths each year from air pollution and climate change. A
            warmer climate increases public health challenges like
            heat-aggravated illnesses, vector borne diseases, and decreased
            access to safe water and food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Climate action is frequently divided into two approaches: adaptation
            are all the actions taken to manage the risks of climate change
            impacts and mitigation is all the actions taken to reduce the
            emissions that cause climate change.

            the state of being adapted: the degree to which an organism is able

        <h1>What is Climate Change ?</h1>
        <div>
          <div class="paras">
            <p>
              Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and
              weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in
              the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the
              1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate
              change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal,
              oil and gas.
            </p>

            <p>
              Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act
              like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat
              and raising temperatures.
            </p>

            <p>
              The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include
              carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for
              driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example.
              Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon
              dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of
              methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings,
              agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing
              greenhouse gases.

        <h1>Humans are responsible for global warming</h1>
        <div>
          <div class="paras">
            <p>
              Climate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for
              virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human
              activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse
              gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at
              least the last two thousand years.
            </p>
            <p>
              The average temperature of the Earth’s surface is now about 1.2°C
              warmer than it was in the late 1800s (before the industrial
              revolution) and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years.
              The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, and each of
              the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade
              since 1850.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures.
              But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because
              the Earth is a system, where everything is connected, changes in
              one area can influence changes in all others.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.</p> -->

        <h1>Every increase in global warming matters</h1>
        <div>
          <div class="paras">
            <p>
              In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government
              reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more
              than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and
              maintain a livable climate. Yet policies currently in place point
              to a 3°C temperature rise by the end of the century.
            </p>
            <p>
              The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of
              the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much
              more than others.The seven biggest emitters alone (China, the
              United States of America, India, the European Union, Indonesia,
              the Russian Federation, and Brazil) accounted for about half of
              all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries
              creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act
              first.

            <p>
              Many climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while
              improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have
              global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the
              Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on
              Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of
              action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and
              financing required adjustments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like
              solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change.
              But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is
              committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in
              half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C. Achieving this means
              huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: over two-thirds of
              today’s proven reserves of fossil fuels need to be kept in the
              ground by 2050 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate
              change.

EPA, we celebrated the Supreme Court’s April 2007 decision declaring CO2 a pollutant under the Clean Air Act, which meant the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under the Act. And in November 2007, the Center and our allies prevailed in CBD v. NHTSA, a major lawsuit filed against the Department of Transportation for failing to properly account for greenhouse gas emissions when setting unreasonably low national fuel economy standards. </p>

          <li>
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Nevertheless the Trump administration finalized a rule to revoke California’s ability to set its own stringent greenhouse gas emissions standards (along with the ability of other states to follow California’s lead), and proposes to roll back the existing, already insufficient standards adopted by the previous administration. We and our allies are fighting back against these disastrous proposals in court.</p>

Other countries, including Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Iceland and Germany, have already pledged to ban the sale of new fossil-fuel cars by 2030. We’re pushing California and the federal EPA to expand renewable electric infrastructure and establish increasingly stringent emissions standards in cars, pickups, buses and trucks, which would prohibit the sale of any new fossil fuel cars no later than 2030. </p>

That is why in 2020 the Center and allies filed a notice of intent to sue the EPA over its failure to develop standards to limit greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft.
